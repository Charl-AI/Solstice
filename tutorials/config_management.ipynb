    "Yuck! You can see that there are loads of components that would be fine on their own, but end up getting glued together by some horrible convoluted logic in the main file. Each time you want to add functionality you will have to add a bunch more if statements - the whole thing is a combinatoric nightmare! You also have the problem that different config options want to be configured differently, for example the resnet needs to know different things to the mlp. This means you end up passing everything into your program and ignoring half of it, which is incredible error prone. We show how Solstice+Hydra fixes this."
