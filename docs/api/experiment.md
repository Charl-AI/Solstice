# Experiment

The `Experiment` is at the heart of Solstice. The API is similar to the one loved by [PyTorch-Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) users, but we do less 'magic' to keep it as transparent as possible. If in doubt, just read the source code - it's really short!
